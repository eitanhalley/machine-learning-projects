# machine-learning-projects
Ben Gurion University machine learning project
In this project I will classify the target variable (house category in Paris, Luxury or Basic ), using the relevant variables from the excel file.
In part A I have cleaned the data set for part B, there I will use machine learning algorithms to classify the target variable.
First, I cleaned the data set by filling in the missing variable with different mathematical evaluations.
Second, I have removed the variables that are not possible, for example, if the size of the basement is bigger than the house size.
Lastly I will use logistic regression to determine which variables are relevant for the classification of the target variable.
